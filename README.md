Simple MQTT-based chat room client written in Ruby

## Install

1. Install and run an MQTT broker. [mosquitto](http://mosquitto.org) is one choice, this also works with [RabbitMQ](http://rabbitmq.com) version 3 which includes MQTT support, and with [many other MQTT servers](http://mqtt.org/software#brokers).

2. Install the [mqtt](http://github.com/njh/ruby-mqtt) and ncurses-ruby gems 
(NB the plain ncurses gem is harder to natively compile)

    ```sudo gem install mqtt ncurses-ruby```

## Run

1. Run the client

    ```ruby ./mqtt-chat.rb <username>```

2. If you want to configure the app to run against an alternative MQTT broker running on a different host/post. Modify this line:

    ```ruby
    mqtt = MQTT::Client.new('localhost')
    ```
    
    replacing 'localhost' with the hostname or IP address of your chosen broker, optionally with a port number, e.g.

    ```ruby
    mqtt = MQTT::Client.new('m2m.eclipse.org', 1883)
    ```
